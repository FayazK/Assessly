# System Patterns

*   **Architecture Overview:** Likely a Monolithic structure leveraging Laravel's Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. InertiaJS acts as a bridge between the Laravel backend and the React frontend, enabling a Single Page Application (SPA) experience without building a separate API. (Inferred from PRD 5.1 & Laravel/Inertia standard practices).
*   **Key Technical Decisions (PRD 5.1 & General):**
    *   Backend Framework: Laravel (PHP)
    *   Frontend Framework: ReactJS with InertiaJS
    *   UI Library: Ant Design v5
    *   Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL
    *   Development Model: Open Source (PRD 2.3)
*   **Design Patterns:** Standard Laravel design patterns (e.g., MVC, Service Container, Facades) are expected. Application-specific patterns (e.g., Repository for data access, Service Layer for business logic) will likely be adopted as development progresses. (Inferred from Laravel best practices).
*   **Component Relationships:** High-level components will likely correspond to core features outlined in the PRD (Question Management, Candidate Management, Interview Management, Results Management). InertiaJS will manage the interaction between Laravel backend controllers/data and React frontend components. Detailed component interactions are yet to be defined. (Inferred from PRD 3.1 & Inertia architecture).
