# Active Context

*   **Current Focus:** Reviewing PRD and planning MVP Phase 1 implementation.
*   **Recent Changes:**
    *   Updated `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` with PRD details (Goal, Features, Audience, Metrics).
    *   Updated `memory-bank/productContext.md` with PRD details (Problem, Solution, UX Goals, Workflows).
    *   Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` based on PRD tech stack and inferences.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` with PRD tech stack, requirements, and constraints.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` with PRD MVP roadmap and current status.
    *   Updated `.clinerules` with initial project context.
*   **Next Steps (Based on PRD 7.1 - Month 1 & PRD 9):**
    *   Refine core system architecture decisions (e.g., confirm database choice).
    *   Plan and begin implementation of basic admin interfaces.
    *   Address open questions from PRD (Section 9): Self-hosting vs. SaaS, code execution approach, data retention policies.
    *   Confirm UI Framework choice (Ant Design specified in PRD vs. Tailwind CSS in initial setup).
    *   Define specific development environment setup (`techContext.md`).
*   **Active Decisions/Considerations:**
    *   **UI Framework:** PRD specifies Ant Design v5, but initial project files (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `resources/css/app.css`) suggest Tailwind CSS. This needs clarification/resolution.
    *   **Open Questions (PRD 9):** Need decisions on deployment model, code execution sandboxing, and data retention.
    *   **Development Setup:** Need to define the specific local development environment (e.g., Herd, Docker, Valet).
