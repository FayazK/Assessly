    *   **Month 3 Target:** Interview Creation implementation (scheduled/instant, question selection, sections, time limits). Interview Conduction implementation (candidate view, timers, question interfaces).
    *   **Month 4 Target:** Results Management implementation (auto/manual evaluation, detailed/summary views). Basic reporting.
    *   **General:** Refine development setup (`techContext.md`), address open questions (PRD 9), implement security measures (PRD 5.3).
